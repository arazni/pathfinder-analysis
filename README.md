# Pathfinder Analysis

This code generates a [website that breaks down various analyses of the Pathfinder 2nd Edition roleplaying game](https://arazni.github.io/pathfinder-analysis/average-level-cantrip.html).

Also visit [my Blades in the Dark (and Scum and Villainy) character sheet app](https://arazni.github.io/blades-in-the-sheets) if you ever need one! It has partial French support and was built with NVDA screen-reader testing!

TODO:

- Bestiary analyses:
  - % "cheating" per level by having will as the weakest save but being immune to mental
  - % with weaknesses by creature family?
  - Bestiary scaling graphs
  - Various accuracy scaling graphs
  - Various damage scaling graphs
